# My FreeCodeCamp Solutions

[FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/danieldrasdo/FreeCodeCamp) is a way for me to log my FCC solutions.

1. Please don't just copy my solutions, but you can check them out for reference.
2. Don't laugh\* at my `code`.
3. If you find that one of my solutions doesn't work anymore, I'd really appreciate it if you could submit an issue.

\* *A slight giggle is fine.*
